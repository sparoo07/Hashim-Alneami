abstract: "Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development discipline which facilitates the releasing of software at any time. Additionally, continuous deployment is an extension of CD in which the continuity is extended to the deployment to production stage. With respect to the current implementation of these disciplines, there were issues and challenges standing in the way of adapting CD and continuous deployment by software companies. In this paper, I conduct a literature review on continuous delivery and continuous deployment in which I define both disciplines and explained their differences. I also discuss the problems regarding them as well as the causes and introduce some of the suggested solutions proposed in previous research papers. I then give an analytical exposition on the existing solutions to CD problems."
